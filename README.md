# Initial Data Science Projects

Welcome to my repository of initial data science projects, completed while studying for the IBM Data Science Professional Certifications. This repository serves as a showcase of my early work and learning experiences in the field of data science. 

## Overview

This repository contains a variety of small projects and labs, each focusing on different aspects of data science. These micro-projects include components such as:

- Python scripts
- Web scraping examples
- Data analysis
- Data visualization

Each project is a standalone component that explores specific concepts and techniques in data science. Some projects are fully completed, while others are partially finished. Together, they represent my journey and growth as a data scientist.

## Contents

Below is a brief description of some of the key projects in this repository:

1. Python Basics: Simple scripts to understand Python syntax and basic programming concepts.
2. Web Scraping: Projects involving data extraction from websites using libraries like BeautifulSoup and Scrapy.
3. Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on various datasets, using pandas and NumPy.
4. Data Visualization: Creating charts and graphs using matplotlib and seaborn to visualize data insights.
5. Machine Learning: Basic implementations of machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn.

## Getting Started

To get started with any project, navigate to the corresponding directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file of that project. Most projects require a Python environment with common data science libraries installed.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
   
## Usage

Each project directory contains a Jupyter notebook or Python script that you can run to explore the code and results. For Jupyter notebooks, you can start a Jupyter notebook server by running:
jupyter notebook
Then, open the desired notebook in your web browser.

## Contributing

This repository is primarily a personal collection of projects. However, if you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
